We can speak with you over the phone, the form below, email, or even text message. You can call or text us at (631) 381-4783 to get started.\n\nWe gather some basic information about your property before meeting you there. This can include beds, baths, square footage, and any upgrades you’ve done recently. We try to be thorough, but also brief since we know your time is valuable.\n\nOnce we know a bit more about your property, we do some research and take a look at the recent cash comparables in your area. From there we will be able to come up with an idea of what we can pay for your home. This is just an estimate that we have prior to meeting you at the property.\n                </p>\n\n\n                <h1>2) Meet With Us At Your Property And Get An Offer </h1>\n                <p>\n                Since we are a local home buying company on Long Island, we will meet you at your property at a time that works best for you. We walk your property with you and discuss some of the details of your home to get the best idea of what repairs might be needed. Don’t worry though, you are not responsible for making any repairs. We handle that for you.\n                </p>\n\n                <h1>3) Attend Closing And Get Your Check</h1>\n                <p>Once you accept our offer, we send our purchase and sale agreement to the attorney you choose to represent you to get the contract drawn up.\n\nOnce contracts are signed by both of us, title work can begin. This can take as little as a few days or sometimes a few weeks. It all depends if there are any challenges in establishing a clear title. Our title company works to clear the title and get our closing ready as quickly as possible. We keep you informed if there are any questions along the way.\n\nOnce the title work is clear, we get the thumbs up to close. The attorneys schedule a day and time to close that works best for you. Once all paperwork is signed, you receive your check or wire with the proceeds from the sale.</p>\n            </div>\n\n\n              </div>\n        )\n    }\n}\n\nexport default howItWorks"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
